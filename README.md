# benchmarking
This repository contains the benchmarking scripts used to benchmark ALEX and a B-tree for CS598 AWG.

# Datasets
- We used the longitudes dataset which is part of OpenStreetMap (https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/06/openstreetmap-public-data-set-now-available-on-aws/). A download of this dataset can be found at https://github.com/microsoft/ALEX.

- We also used the Uniform 64-bit integer dataset from SOSD. The dataset can be found here: https://github.com/learnedsystems/SOSD/blob/master/gen_uniform.py
